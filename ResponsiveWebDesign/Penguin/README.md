## Overview

### The challenge

- In this project, the challenge was to build a penguin and use CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of the penguin, create a background, and animate the work.

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

- My major takeaway from this project was seeing how objects changed as you coded them and sometimes they look odd until you've completed the last line.

Below is some code that I found most interesting or am proud of:

```HTML
<div class="shirt">
    <div>ðŸ’œ</div>
    <p>I CSS</p>
</div>
```

```CSS
@keyframes wave {
    10% {
        transform: rotate(110deg) scaleX(-1);
    }
    20% {
        transform: rotate(130deg) scaleX(-1);
    }
    30% {
        transform: rotate(110deg) scaleX(-1);
    }
    40% {
        transform: rotate(130deg) scaleX(-1);
    }
}
```

### Continued development

- I'm not sure making images with CSS is my forte, but being able to simply animate something on the page is a useful idea I'd like to incorporate into pages as I work on them.
