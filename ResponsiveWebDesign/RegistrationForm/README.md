## Overview

### The challenge

- In this project, we learned HTML forms by building a signup page, how to control what types of data people can type into a form, and some new CSS tools for styling the page.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

<!-- - My major takeaways from this project include a greater understanding of the hsl and hex color values as well as using the border to help produce an image.

Below is some code that I found most interesting or am proud of:

```html
    <div class="marker red">
        <div class="cap"></div>
        <div class="sleeve"></div>
      </div>
```

```CSS
    .sleeve {
    width: 110px;
    height: 25px;
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
    border-left: 10px double rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
 }
```

### Continued development

- Both rgb and hsl are a bit more intuitive for me, I'd like to dive deeper into hex and know more about how the naming convention produces the color. I'm still unsure how a single-digit scale of 1-9 and A-F combine in a two-digit number to produce a color. -->
