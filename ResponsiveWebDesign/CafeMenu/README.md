## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- My major takeaways from this project include noticing the collection of basic fundamental collections of CSS properties that'll be applied to most projects.

Below is some code that I found most interesting or am proud of:

```html
    <article class="item">
      <p class="flavor">French Vanilla</p><p class="price">3.00</p>
    </article>
```

```CSS
    .item p {
      display: inline-block;
      margin-top: 5px;
      margin-bottom: 5px;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
```

### Continued development

- During the development, I was reminded of selecting nested elements within a class that can be styled separately.
