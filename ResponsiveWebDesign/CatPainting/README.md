## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- My major takeaway from this project were learning more about media queries and and aplying them in new and interesting ways.

Below is some code that I found most interesting or am proud of:

```CSS
.cat-mouth div {
    width: 30px;
    height: 50px;
    border: 2px solid #000;
    border-radius: 190%/190px 150px 0 0;
    border-color: black transparent transparent transparent;
  }
```

### Continued development

- The border radius value was interesting and showed me that more properties can take formulae leading me to wonder what other properties can take formulae.
