## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Accessibility
- Responsive Web Design

### What I learned

- My major takeaway from this project was how how long a site can take to code. Even when emulating from an example, breaking things down into indivdual components can take time. But that's also how a mammoth project can get done; one piece at a time.

Below is some code that I found most interesting or am proud of:

```html
<div class="card">
    <a target="_blank" href="https://...">
        <img src="./ProductLandingPage.png" alt="info">
    </a>
    <div class="project-title"><h3>Product Page</h3></div>
</div>
```

```CSS
.clearfix:after {
    content: "";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
}
```

### Continued development

- This was a great project that was both frustrating and exciting as I found nuances of the example and found my own way of coding them to make them work. I think finding other examples of sites and elements of sites would be a great way to practice skills and build a repitoire to build other sites from.
